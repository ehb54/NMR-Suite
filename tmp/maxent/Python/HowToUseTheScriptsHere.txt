1) First you need to have a matrix A with the predictions (pcs,rdc, ...) for the ensemble you are using.
   You also need the y data, which is the experimental data you are using. 
   I am attaching a ydata and Amatrix in this folder as an example for the right format.
   Note: In Python, there is no need to "load" any of the data, it is already there.

2) With A and y, you will run RunMaxEntropy.py script. 
   This script also uses a range of lambda values that have pre defined values, but it should be adjusted in each case.
   After running the script, you will have output saved in the folder result_of_maxent to be used for the other scripts.

3) The next script to use is L_curveForBestLambda.py. 
   This script will load the folder result_of_maxent.mat.
   After running the script, you will have index.txt saved to be used for the other scripts.

4) With that you already can plot the results of MaxEntropy for your entire ensemble using PlotResultsBeforeCluster.py. 

5) If you want to cluster to have your results more clear, then you should use ClusterByWeight.py next. 
   This script will load the folder result_of_maxent and the file index.txt.
   This will save cluster.mat that you will use for the other scripts.
